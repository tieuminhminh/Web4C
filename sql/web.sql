From there, I met my one Parisian friend and her friends for some wine and cheese. That little outing to a park turned into a late-night wine fueled bar crawl that ended at some ’50s-style American sock hop. (Seriously. I couldn’t believe it. Here I am, in a bar in Paris, and people are dressed up and dancing like it’s 1953. It was kind of incredible.)\r\n<br>\r\nBut, after that wild night, life slowed to a crawl.\r\n\r\nI spent my first week here settling in: I got a SIM card, saw a plethora of apartments (and finally picked one), signed up for French classes, and tried to catch up on work. (I thought about joining a gym but, in paperwork-loving France, you need a doctor’s note saying you’re fit enough to join. I’m told most people don’t follow that rule but, for now, I can’t be bothered.)\r\n\r\nAfter that first week, I moved into my new apartment, went to some meetups in hopes of making friends, and flew to Berlin for ITB, the largest travel conference in the world.\r\n<br>\r\nUpon returning to Paris, I came down with a terrible cold and spent the last week inside my apartment trying to recover. Just when I had hoped to hit the ground running, life had other ideas.<br>\r\n\r\nNow, as I hit my first full month here, I’m finally feeling better (and thanks to spending so long inside, I’m fairly caught up on work).<br>\r\n\r\nThe timing couldn’t be more perfect. The weather is getting warmer and sunnier again. Over the next few weeks, I start hosting a plethora of visitors, which will finally get me out of my apartment and exploring the city more. (I’ve lined up a lot of activities, which are basically the museums, tours, and shows I’ve yet to see, so my friends are going to get a very off-the-beaten-path look at Paris.)<br>\r\nI’ve been getting a lot of questions about my time here, so here are some answers to for anyone wondering:\r\n<br>\r\n<b>1. How did I find an apartment so quickly?</b>\r\n<br>I got lucky. Someone on Twitter connected me with someone who rented out apartments. And having a decent budget allowed me to find a place quicker. I was going through some agencies and looking at Facebook groups and Le Bon Coin (French Craigslist), but that personal connection made it a lot easier.<br>\r\n\r\nFinding an apartment here in Paris is hard even for the French. It’s a long process filled with a lot of paperwork. The way New Yorkers talk about the price of an apartment is the way people here talk about finding an apartment. It’s the first topic of discussion, as a way to bond with strangers.<br>\r\n\r\n<b>2. Are you studying French?</b><br> If so, where?\r\nI was taking French classes at Alliance Française but, disliking the classroom teaching style, dropped out and hired a private tutor. I’m also learning via podcasts and Duolingo.\r\n<br>\r\n<b>3. How are you meeting people and making friends as an expat?</b>\r\n<br>\r\nThere’s a bunch of expat meetup groups I’ve joined, and I started hosting my own meetups. I am also reaching out influencers based in France. But if you know of any cool Parisian locals, let me know!\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<b>4. I heard you’re running walking tours. Is that true?</b><br>\r\nYep! I started running my own historical walking tours. You can sign up here. I have put up the schedule through the end of May. I do them once a week and they’re free. Come join! If a date is full, join the waitlist. A few people always end up canceling!', 1, 4, 6, 1, 1, 0, '2018-06-05 09:38:13'),

You’ll be able to move around most of the city and never expose yourself to the heat and humidity. Since it gets cool at night, it can save you from having to pay extra for A/C at your hotel or hostel. Plus, you can spend your afternoon wandering underground Singapore without spending any money.\r\n<br>\r\n<b>2. Eat Cheap Food in Little India</b>\r\n<br>\r\nSingapore has some great food, but many of the restaurants are expensive. However, one of the best places to eat is the area of Little India, where great Indian meals cost as little as 5 SGD. Make sure you find the places where you can eat with your hands! They’re the most authentic and local places. You’ll probably be the only Westerner in there, though, so be prepared for people to stare. Eating at these places was still the most fun I had in Singapore.\r\n<br>\r\nMake sure you stop off at the Tekka Center, a hawker center with Indian clothing, groceries, and food. The food here is cheap and delcious and makes for an authentic Little India experience.\r\n<br>\r\nFor a sit-down restaurant experience, head to Ananda Bhavan. It’s the country’s oldest vegetarian restaurant and is definitely worth a visit for some delicious Southern Indian cuisine.

(7, 'HOW TO GET AROUND JAPAN ON A BUDGET', 'Japan', 'getaroundjapan1.jpg', 'get-around-japan-on-low-budget', 'japan, travel, cheap', 'I have a confession to make: I put off traveling to Japan until 2011 because I always thought it was too expensive.\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone always told me Japan was one of the most expensive countries in the world. That was the collective wisdom.\r\n<br>\r\nBut, when I got there, I realized two things: First, I love Japan! It’s one of the most amazing, beautiful, and friendliest countries in the world. It lives up to all the hype.\r\n<br>\r\nSecond, while Japan is expensive, it’s not out of reach for budget travelers.\r\n<br>\r\nThere are many cheap ways to enjoy Japan on a budget.\r\n<br>\r\nFrom finding delicious food to affordable hotels to fun activities, you don’t have to pinch every penny have fun.\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the one thing that is truly expensive in Japan? Quick transportation.\r\n<br>\r\nWhile it’s not a huge country, the island nation’s transportation infrastructure is geared to expensive, high-speed travel or inexpensive, (really) low-speed travel. There’s not much in between. It’s a three-hour train ride or a 12-hour bus ride!\r\n<br>\r\nSo what are the best ways to travel around Japan without spending all your money on transportation?\r\n<br>\r\nIn this post, I’ll break that down (because it does require some work).\r\n<br>\r\nJapan’s infamous bullet trains (called shinkansen) are beautiful, comfortable, convenient, and fast. They are a wonder of transportation, racing around at speeds up to 320 km (200 miles) per hour. These trains run on special tracks, separate from the other trains.\r\n<br>\r\nThey are a beautiful feat of engineering and a smooth ride. It’s the best in train travel.\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, they are also very, very expensive.\r\n<br>\r\nIndividual tickets can cost hundreds of dollars — even more than airfare. To travel on a bullet train, you pay a basic train fare, then there’s an additional “super express fee” of 800 to 8,000 JPY ($7.50 to $75). For example, a one-way ticket from Kyoto to Hiroshima can cost 11,300 JPY ($105 USD), from Tokyo to Kyoto is 13,710 JPY ($126 USD), from Osaka to Tokyo is around 15,000 JPY ($140 USD), and from Tokyo to Nagasaki is 25,850 ($240 USD).\r\n<br>\r\nTo make matters worse, there are very rarely promotions or discounts. And, unless you know Japanese, they are nearly impossible to find.\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, there are other options. Japan also has regular limited express and regional trains. Naturally, they are much slower than the shinkansen, but they are also cheaper.\r\n<br>\r\nFor example, a trip on a local train from Kyoto to Tokyo will cost around 8,000 JPY ($73 USD) instead of 13,710 JPY ($126 USD) for the bullet train. However, the journey will take 9 hours instead of 3 hours and will also require several transfers, making it a less than an ideal choice for most travelers.\r\n<br>\r\nWhether you opt for the bullet train or regional trains, I think train travel is the best way to see the country. It’s just not a good idea to buy individual tickets. In order to reduce your train costs, you need to get a Japan Rail (JR) pass.\r\n<br>\r\nThe passes are good for JR trains — both regular trains as well as the shinkansen bullet trains! — which go to nearly every destination and region in the country. What I really like is that these JR trains also serve metropolitan areas, so they can be used within cities. On my last visit, I used my pass to get around Kyoto and Tokyo instead of buying metro tickets.\r\n<br>\r\nThe JR pass is indispensable for travel in Japan, as you get unlimited rides with it. The pass has several options (each valid for consecutive days, not just travel days):<br>\r\n\r\n29,110 JPY ($267 USD) for 7 days<br>\r\n46,390 JPY ($426 USD) for 14 days<br>\r\n59,350 JPY ($545 USD) for 21 days<br>\r\nEven if you get just the seven-day JR pass, it will still cost less than a round-trip train ticket from Osaka to Tokyo. And you can still do a lot in seven days (it’s a small country, after all!)\r\n<br>\r\nThe JR Pass is good on several types of JR trains. After the shinkansen, the next fastest is the tokkyu (limited express). The kyuko express train comes next, followed by the kaisoku and futs? (local trains that make every stop).\r\n<br>\r\nEach of these passes also has a first-class option. First-class cars in Japan are called “green cars.” The Green Car JR Pass will be around 10,000 JPY ($92 USD) more for each pass. Since the trains in Japan are already amazing, you likely don’t need to buy the Green Car pass unless you really want some luxury.\r\n<br>\r\nThere are regional options as well if you are not traveling the entire country. These options will save you even more money since they are cheaper than the regular JR passes. You can buy JR passes for six different regions of the country:\r\n<br>\r\nJR East\r\nJR West\r\nJR Central\r\nJR Hokkaido (the northern island)\r\nJR Kyushu (the southwestern island)\r\nJR Shikoku (the southeastern island)\r\nEach region will have several pass options, usually ranging between 1-7 days. If you’re just going to be focusing on one region of the country, consider buying a JR regional pass. If you want to explore everywhere, get the regular JR Pass. (If you’re a first-time visitor to Japan, you’ll likely want the regular JR Pass, as it covers all the major destinations.)\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing to keep in mind is that you have to buy your JR Pass before you come to Japan. So make sure you have your “exchange order” (the receipt for your pass) before you leave home! Once you get to Japan, you will exchange your “exchange order” for a JR Pass at a JR office. Make sure you have your passport when you go to collect it!\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, they are currently allowing travelers to buy their passes on arrival in some locations, but this is just a test that is set to end in March 2019. Until then, here is where you can buy your pass in Japan: Sapporo, Sendai, Niigata, Tokyo, Shinjuku, Yokohama, Nagoya, Osaka, Hiroshima, Takamatsu, Hakata, New Chitose Airport, Narita Airport, Haneda Airport, and Kansai Airport. The pass is available mainly to non-Japanese travelers who are visiting for a limited time. When you apply for the pass, you will provide your nationality and travel details. You will need your passport to collect your pass.', 1, 7, 6, 1, 1, 1, '2019-05-30 04:14:00'),

Located off the eastern coast of Africa, this island, nearly the size of France and the third largest in the world, has a population over 20 million but sees only about 325,000 tourists a year.1 I spent two weeks there with Intrepid Travel Travel and was surprised by how few tourists there were (I figured — with no data to back it up — that there would be a lot more), as well as by just how difficult the country was to travel around. The roads are really, really bad. It can take up to eight hours to go 250 km (155 miles) — and that’s on the good roads!\r\n<br>\r\nBut soon it became clear why there were so few tourists: getting to the country is expensive, there’s very little information about it online, few organized activities, and only a couple hostels, tourism information centers, helpful signs, or anything that would be considered a “tourist infrastructure” (and sadly, very little infrastructure at all). Madagascar’s tourism caters to older Europeans who visit expensive beach resorts or take organized tours, moving around the country in a little bubble. Nary a backpacker did I see on my trip.<br>\r\n\r\nMadagascar is a raw, barely explored place. It’s on few people’s radar, and I doubt it will be for awhile, making now an ideal time to go. It’s cheap (once you get there), your tourist dollars can create a really positive impact, and there are few crowds and many cute lemurs and majestic landscapes, which you get virtually to yourself!\r\n<br>\r\nHow to get there<br>\r\nThe first thing you need to know is that getting to Madagascar is not easy: there’s only one daily flight from Johannesburg, Air France has one daily from Paris, and only Turkish, Kenyan, and Ethiopian Airlines have flights that connect to other destinations.\r\n<br>\r\nI jumped on a flight deal to Johannesburg ($630 USD for New York to Johannesburg and then onward to Vienna) but that was a stupid thing to do. Given the price of flights from JNB to Madagascar (I paid $800 USD round-trip), it ended costing me more than just booking a direct ticket to Madagascar.\r\n<br>\r\nI was pretty stupid not looking up flights enough beforehand and waiting until the last minute, but even “booking smart” doesn’t mean you’ll find a deal.

(11, 'THE ATLAS OF HAPPINESS: DISCOVERING THE WORLD’S SECRET TO HAPPINESS WITH HELEN RUSSELL', 'Helen Russell', 'helenrussell1.jpg', 'secret-to-happiness', 'helen, russell, atlas, secret', 'A few years ago, I read the book The Year of Living Danishly by Helen Russell. I think it originally came up as a suggested book on Amazon. I can’t fully remember. But, I stuck it in my queue, ordered it, and it sat on my bookshelf until it was time to read it. I couldn’t put it down. It was funny, well written, interesting, and an insightful look into Danish culture. It was one of my favorite books I read that year.\r\n<br><br>\r\nLast year, I somehow convinced Helen to speak at TravelCon and got to meet her in person. Now, she has a new book out called The Atlas of Happiness. It’s about why people in certain places are happier than others. It’s a phenomenal book (you should get it). Today, Helen shares some of what she learned in researching that book!\r\n<br><br>\r\nHere’s a funny thing: if you’ve been online today for more than a fraction of a second, you may have started to get the sense that the world is A Terrible Place. Even the committed traveler with an open mind could be forgiven for thinking that the outlook is pretty bleak.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAnd if you’ve seen the headlines today or been on social media and you’re feeling low as a result, you’re not alone.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIt’s easy to get the idea that the world is becoming more miserable by the minute and that happiness is a luxury in these troubled times.\r\n<br><br>\r\nBut over the past six years, I’ve learned that there are people all around the world finding ways to stay happy, every day. And that happiness is something we’re hardwired to seek out – wherever we are.\r\n<br><br>\r\nI started researching happiness in 2013 when I relocated from the UK to Denmark. I’d spent 12 years living and working in London as a journalist, and I had no intention of leaving, until out of the blue one wet Wednesday, my husband came home and told me he’d been offered his dream job…working for Lego in rural Jutland. I was skeptical to start with — I had a good career, a nice flat, great friends, close family — I had a life.\r\n<br><br>\r\nOkay, so my husband and I both worked long hours, we were tired all the time, and never seemed to be able to see each other very much. We regularly had to bribe ourselves to get through the day and we’d both been ill on and off for the past six months.\r\n<br><br>\r\nBut that was normal, right?\r\n<br><br>\r\nWe thought we were ‘living the dream.’ I was 33 years old and we’d also been trying for a baby for as long as either of us could remember, enduring years of fertility treatment, but we were always so stressed that it never quite happened.\r\n<br><br>\r\nSo when my husband was offered a job in Denmark, this ‘other life’ possibility was dangled in front of us — the chance to swap everything we knew for the unknown. Denmark had just been voted the world’s happiest country in the UN’s annual report and I became fascinated by this. How had a tiny country of just 5.5m people managed to pull off the happiest nation on earth title? Was there something in the water? And if we couldn’t get happier in Denmark, where could we get happier?\r\n<br><br>\r\nDuring our first visit, we noticed that there was something a bit different about the Danes we met. They didn’t look like us, for starters — quite apart from the fact that they were all strapping Vikings towering over my 5’3” frame — they looked more relaxed and healthier. They walked more slowly. They took their time to stop and eat together, or talk, or just…breathe.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAnd we were impressed.\r\n<br><br>\r\nMy Lego Man husband was sold on the idea and begged me to move, promising we’d relocate for my career next time. And I was so worn out by my hectic London life that I found myself agreeing. I quit my job to go freelance and decided I would give it a year, investigating the Danish happiness phenomenon first hand — looking at a different area of living each month to find out what Danes did differently.\r\n<br><br>\r\nFrom food to family life; work culture to working out; and design to the Danish welfare state — each month I would throw myself into living ‘Danishly’ to see if it made me any happier and if I could change the way I lived as a result. I decided I would interview as many Danes, expats, psychologists, scientists, economists, historians, sociologists, politicians, everyone, in fact, to try to uncover the secrets to living Danishly.\r\n<br><br>\r\nI documented my experiences for two UK newspapers before being asked to write a book: The Year of Living Danishly, Uncovering the Secrets of the World’s Happiest Country.\r\n<br><br>\r\nSince then, I’ve been humbled and moved to hear from readers from across the globe with wide-ranging life perspectives, but the one constant was a need to share the happiness secrets of their own cultures. Some of the themes that sprung out were universal — such as social interactions, exercising out of doors and finding a balance in life — while others were intriguingly unique.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe Atlas of Happiness book cover by Helen RussellSo I set out to research into unique happiness concepts from around the world, interviewing people internationally until The Atlas of Happiness — my new book-baby — was born. It isn’t a compendium of the happiest countries; instead, it’s a look at what’s making people happier in different places. Because if we only look at the countries already coming top of the happiness polls, we miss out on ideas and knowledge from cultures we’re less familiar with.\r\n<br><br>\r\nNowhere is perfect. Every country has faults. But I wanted to celebrate the best parts of a country’s culture as well as national characteristics at their finest – because that’s what we should all be aiming for.\r\n<br><br>\r\nHere are a few of my favorites:\r\n<br><br>\r\nDid you know, for example, that in Portuguese there’s something called saudade — a feeling of longing, melancholy, and nostalgia for a happiness that once was — or even a happiness you merely hoped for?\r\n<br><br>\r\nAnd while Brazil may be famous for its carnival spirit, the flipside of this, saudade, is so central to the Brazilian psyche that it’s even been given its own official ‘day’ on the 30th of January every year.\r\n<br><br>\r\nMost of us will have experienced a bittersweet pleasure in moments of melancholy — flicking through old photos, or caring about anyone enough to miss them when they’re gone.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAnd scientists have found that this temporary sadness — counter-intuitively — makes us happier: providing catharsis; improving our attention to detail; increasing perseverance and promoting generosity. So we should all spend time remembering those we’ve loved and lost — then practice being a little more grateful for the ones still around.\r\n<br><br>\r\nFinland ranked number one in this year’s UN World Happiness report thanks to a great quality of life, free healthcare, and education funded by high taxes.\r\n<br><br>\r\nBut there’s also something else the Finns enjoy that’s infinitely more exportable: kalsarikännit — defined as ‘drinking at home in your underwear with no intention of going out’ — a pursuit so popular it even has its own emoji, commissioned by The Finnish Foreign Ministry.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn common with most Scandinavians, Finns aren’t shy about disrobing, and they all have such enviably well-insulated houses that stripping down to their pants is apparently completely okay even when it’s minus 35 degrees outside. What you drink and crucially how much of it you knock back is down to the individual, but it’s a uniquely Finnish form of happiness and mode of relaxation that we can all give a go.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn Greece, they have a concept called meraki that refers to an introspective, precise expression of care, usually applied to a cherished pastime — and it’s keeping Greeks happy despite turbulent times. This is because having a hobby improves our quality of life according to scientists, and challenging ourselves to do something different also creates new neural pathways in our brain. Having a passion that you take pride can be of extra benefit to those who can’t say the same for their primary occupation.\r\n<br><br>\r\nBecause meraki can make life worthwhile if your 9-5 is more of a daily grind. Many tasks that need to be taken care of on a day-to-day basis aren’t particularly challenging or inspiring – from filing, to raising purchase orders or even — dare I say it — some of the more gruelling aspects of parenting.\r\n<br><br>\r\nBut we can break up the never-ending cycle of mundane work with our own personal challenges — things that we’re passionate about that we can genuinely look forward to doing. Our meraki.\r\n<br><br>\r\nDolce far niente — or the sweetness of doing nothing — is a much-treasured concept in Italy — often hashtagged on Instagram accompanying pictures of Italians in hammocks. Okay, so Italy hasn’t exactly topped any happiness rankings in recent years, but the cliché of the carefree Italian still exists – and with good reason.\r\n<br><br>\r\nItalians do ‘nothing’ like no other nation and perfecting the art takes style and skill – because there’s more to it than meets the eye. It’s watching the world go by over coffee and a cornetto. It’s laughing at tourists. Or politicians. And crucially it’s about savoring the moment and really enjoying the present. Many of us search for relaxation by traveling to exotic locations, drinking to oblivion, or trying to blot out the noise of modern life.\r\n<br><br>\r\nBut Italians let the chaos wash over them. Instead of saving up our ‘fun quota’ for an annual escape, they spread it over the minutes, hours and days throughout the year and ‘enjoy life’ in all its messy reality.\r\n<br><br>\r\nOne of the happiest countries in the world, the Norwegians must be doing something right. And quite aside from their enviable Scandi-lifestyles and the safety net of all that oil, Norwegians have a secret ace card up their sleeves: a concept called friluftsliv. This roughly translates as ‘free air life’ and it’s a code of conduct as well as a life goal for most Norwegians – who like to spend time outdoors and get high, as often as possible.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAnyone who’s ever visited the country will know that if you meet a Norwegian out in nature, their objective tends to be the highest mountain nearby – and there’s a saying in Norway that “You must make an effort before you can have pleasure’.\r\n<br><br>\r\nMost Norwegians believe you have to work for things, to earn them with physical endeavors, battling the elements. Only once you’ve climbed a mountain in the rain and cold, can you truly enjoy your dinner. It’s an old fashioned approach to the good life but numerous studies show that using our bodies and getting out into nature as often as possible boosts mental and physical wellbeing.\r\n\r\n', 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 111, '2019-05-04 00:00:34'),
(12, 'HOW MUCH DOES IT COST TO TRAVEL WESTERN EUROPE?', 'Travel to Europe', 'costofparis.jpg', 'cost-travel-to-europe', 'travel, europe, cost', 'It’s an expensive place and prices vary greatly depending on how far north, east, south or west your travel. Europe covers a huge area of the world with multiple visa zones and multiple currencies. For 20 euros, you can get a private room in Greece. For that same price in Paris, you may get a 16 person dorm room. You can eat for a few euros in Spain or Hungary, but a sit-down meal in Italy will cost around 15 euros, and triple that in Norway!\r\n<br><br>\r\nI’ve been going to Europe for close to ten years now.\r\n<br><br>\r\nA trip to Europe isn’t cheap, but there are plenty of ways to cut down costs. Since Europe is so big, today I want to talk about traveling around Western Europe and the Eurozone countries.\r\n<br><br>\r\nOne of the most asked questions I get is “how much does it cost to travel to Europe?”\r\n<br><br>\r\nWell, today, let’s talk about planning a trip to Europe!\r\n<br><br>\r\nHow much do things cost?<br><br>\r\nHere are some general costs for things in Europe, because as I said, prices can vary a lot depending on where you are:\r\n<br><br>\r\nAccommodation: In most Western European countries, expect to pay 25–35 euros per night for a dorm room. (Though in Greece and Spain, it’s only 10–20 euros per night.) In Scandinavia, expect to pay around 30–35 Euros per night. In England, prices are usually around 20–30 pounds per night.\r\nFood: Food costs vary as wildly as accommodation costs. Cheap fast food meals cost 9–15 euros, while restaurants meals cost around 15–25 euros. Nicer establishments will cost 30 euros or more. You can cook your food for a week for around 65 euros>.<br><br>\r\nTransportation: The easiest way to get around Europe is by train. Trains connect every major part of Europe, and they’re often very cheap. High-speed trains, though, can cost over 100 euros. Try to get the regional or slow trains for cheaper prices! The rise of cheap airlines like Ryanair, EasyJet, and Transavia has made flying around Europe in a hurry really cheap. For flights, expect to pay around 50 euros if you book in advance. Transportation around most cities is only 1–2 euros.<br><br>\r\nActivities: Most museums and tours start at around 14 euros. It’s cheaper, of course, in eastern Europe. Full-day tours cost 35–100 euros. Prices vary drastically per country, so it’s hard to give a good general cost of this budget item.<br><br>\r\nWANT TO PLAN A BETTER TRIP TO EUROPE?<br><br>\r\nGet all my best Europe travel tips as well as this FREE travel starter kit sent to your email right away.<br>\r\nHOW TO STAY PAST THE 90 DAY LIMIT<br>\r\n61 SAVVY TRAVEL TIPS<br>\r\nTHE ULTIMATE PACKING CHECKLIST<br>\r\nMY FAVORITE COMPANIES TO USE<br>\r\n17 STEPS TRIP PLANNING CHECKLIST<br>\r\nFirst Name<br><br>\r\n <br><br>\r\nEmail Address\r\n <br>\r\nWe use this field to detect spam bots. If you fill this in, you will be marked as a spammer.<br>\r\n SEND ME MY TIPS!<br>\r\nHow to Save Money in Western Europe<br>\r\nBeautiful view of the Western European homes in Cinque Terre, Italy=<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicnic – Europe has a lot of tiny shops where you can be premade sandwiches or ingredients to make your own. Buy some food, eat outside, and watch the city go by. It’s a cheaper and more enjoyable way to eat.<br>\r\nEat Local and Cheap – Not into picnicking? That’s OK, there are other ways to save money on food. Eat at local sandwich shops, pizza parlors, Maoz, Wok to Walks, outdoor street vendors, and the like. Avoiding restaurants and eating at a lot of the local “grab ‘n go” places will give you a taste of the local cuisine at a much cheaper price.<br>\r\nCouchsurf – Hostels can add up really quick in Europe. If you don’t have any friends you can stay with, consider using the service Couchsurfing, which lets you connect with locals who will let you stay with them for free.\r\nFly Cheap – If you know where you’re going and a train won’t do, try to book flights early. You can often get one-euro fares from many of the discount airlines like Transavia, Easyjet, Air Berlin, and Ryanair. MORE: There are many cheap ways to get across Europe.<br>\r\nDrink Less – Those five-euro beers really add up. Hit happy hour or pick and choose when you party. Hostel bars are a good place to get cheap drinks, or you can buy your alcohol at the supermarket. Partying your way across the continent will destroy your bank balance in no time.<br>\r\nTake the Free Tours – One of the great things about Europe is that you can find free walking tours in all the major cities. They can be a great way to see the city attractions, learn some history, and get your bearings without spending any money. Almost every city in Europe has a free walking tour available. Your hostel or the tourism board will have details!<br>\r\nCamp in a garden – A very good camping service specific is Campspace (formerly Camp in My Garden), which allows you to pitch a tent in someone’s backyard for free or a nominal fee (around 4-10 EUR). This is a new service that started in 2010 but more and more people are signing up for it each day. All of the garden owners have profiles that tell you what services and facilities they offer.<br>\r\nGet a Rail Pass – Eurail Passes have saved me hundreds of dollars when I used them. If you are traveling far distances and through many countries, they are a great deal. Here’s more information how to pick a Eurail pass.<br>\r\nGet a city tourist card – Local tourism offices issue a tourist card for all their attractions, tours, and restaurants. This card gives you free entry and substantial discounts on all the attractions and tours in a city, free local public transportation (a huge plus), and discounts at a few restaurants and shopping malls. They save a ton of money. If you plan on doing a lot of sightseeing, get one of these cards.<br>\r\nRideshare – Hugely popular and widespread in Europe, I did this to get around Switzerland, France, and UK. BlaBlaCar, the biggest website, connects drivers and riders and lets you get around much cheaper than a bus or train. Moreover, this way is amazing for getting off the highways, seeing more the countryside, and meeting locals. It’s money-saving and much more exciting than taking the train or bus!<br>\r\nWhat’s a good daily budget in Europe?<br>\r\nthe cost of traveling western europe<br>\r\nRecently, I went through Amsterdam, Greece, Italy, and Hungary. In 59 days of traveling, I spent 4,317 euros, which averages out to 73.17 euros per day. That includes a few flights, many a nice meal, too many drinks on Ios, a few nights of private rooms (it was my birthday, after all!), and some unexpected purchases (a jacket, a new iPhone charger, and new headphones).<br><br>\r\n\r\nSo how much does it cost to travel Europe?<br><br>\r\n\r\nOn a backpacker budget, if you were avoiding flights, occasionally Couchsurfing, staying in cheap dorms, and cooking most of your meals, you could average between 40-50 Eur per day. It would be a tight budget but you could definitely do it. One of the biggest costs in Europe is accommodation so reducing that cost will help a lot!\r\n<br><br>\r\nHowever, if you wanted some flexibility in your schedule, planned to eat out only stay in hostels, and visit a lot of places, plan for around 70 euros a day.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIf you’re going to stay in only private rooms or Airbnb as well as eat at sit down restaurants every meal, I’d say budget closer to 100 euros to be safe.', 2, 4, 6, 1, 1, 1234, '2019-05-04 06:00:25');

After gorging on Nutella, cheese, sausage, beer, pasta, goulash, or whatever else is put in front of me as I traverse the continent every summer, my bikini body needs some work. Europe has just too many world-class places to eat, drink, and be merry!\r\n<br><br>\r\nBut, as I took that second bite, I thought, “Screw it. Bring me a second crêpe. You only live once!”\r\n<br><br>\r\nAnd so I continue eating my way across the continent.\r\n<br><br>\r\nA few years ago, I listed my favorite restaurants in Europe, but since that time, I’ve eaten a lot of food at a lot of new restaurants. I’ve been to new cities, countries, and locales that deserve some culinary attention, so today, it’s time to share a second list of eateries in Europe that — while they may ruin your bikini body — will bring you a lifetime of bliss and memories:\r\n<br><br>\r\nNote: I included a few favorites from my old list (which you can visit here) because I eat at them over and over and over again!\r\n<br><br>\r\nLe Dit Vin (68 Rue Blanche, Paris)\r\nI stumbled across this restaurant while looking for a place to eat near my Airbnb. I spied lots of wine bottles on the wall and someone eating cheese and thought “PERFECT!” It was an incredible find. The prices are reasonable (under 15 euros [$16 USD] for a meal), there is a large wine selection (it’s Paris, of course!), and the food is rich, savory, and delicious. The menu changes daily depending on what’s fresh, so all I can really recommend as a constant is the cheese plate.\r\n<br><br>\r\nMoeders (Rozengracht 251, Amsterdam)\r\nMeaning “mothers” in Dutch, this restaurant is famous for serving traditional Dutch cuisine. It’s a small place (you’ll want to make reservations) filled with portraits of people’s mothers (feel free to add to their collection!) with outdoor seating in the summer. The best value is the Dutch sampler for two, where you can sample a heaping of traditional Dutch food, including lots of potatoes, cabbage, and meat. The fish of the day is always a winner, as is their carpaccio, spare ribs, and hotchpotch (a thick stew with vegetables and meat). A main will set you back 15-20 euros ($16-22 USD) but it’s worth the price!\r\n<br><br>\r\nU Medvídku (Na Perštýn 7, Prague)\r\nThis restaurant is one of the oldest in the city and somewhere I take my tour groups every year. Czech food is heavy on the meat and potatoes, and this spot is no exception. Here you can find a mouthwatering selection of home-brewed beer, heavy goulash, thick potato dumplings, duck, and perfectly cooked pork. Portions are huge (the pork knee is really for two). Prices are 120-200 CZK for a meal. (Another excellent place that serves traditional food is Kravin (Námstí Míru 109/18, Prague), which is a popular after work drinks destinations).\r\n<br><br>\r\nEastern European goulash dinner - Prague\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe Naschmarkt Vienna\r\nCentrally located near the main ring road of Vienna, this outdoor market is lined with restaurants, cafés, and wine bars and is popular with locals and — thanks to lots of mentions in guides and blogs — tourists alike (yes, I’m doing my part!). You’ll be able to choose from a selection of kebab vendors, snack shops, and vegetarian restaurants. (You’ll also find food stalls selling vegetables and deli goods, but prices are higher than other markets in town so I wouldn’t recommend getting those things here.) On a warm day, I love coming here and eating outside and having a glass of wine.\r\n<br><br>\r\nDer Wiener Deewan (Liechtensteinstraße 10, Vienna)\r\nThis all-you-can-eat, pay-what-you-want Pakistani restaurant is popular with students (and cheapos like me; most people pay 5-10 euros for their meal). It’s also insanely tasty, serving up daal, naan, salads, chicken, chutney, and at least a few other dishes (usually around six total) each night. Because it is so cheap and tasty, it is always crowded, so if you’re a big group or going during peak eating hours, you’ll most likely need to wait for a seat. I visit every time I’m in Vienna.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAneka Rasa (Warmoesstraat 25-29, Amsterdam)\r\nThere’s a lot of Indonesian food in Amsterdam, given their past colonization of the country. While there are many options in the city, I like this one the best because you get a lot of food for your money and it’s a great place for groups. You can order the sampler platter (about 10 dishes) for 20 euros ($21 USD) per person. You’ll leave full and with leftovers for later. I’m especially addicted to the rice cakes they bring out as an appetizer.\r\n\r\nLeo Burdock (4 Crown Alley, Temple Bar, Dublin)\r\nThis well-established restaurant (over 100 years old!) serves fantastic fish and chips. It’s simple, easy, and delicious. Unlike a lot of other fish-and-chips shops, I didn’t find the food here too oily; it was perfectly fried and crisp. They don’t have an extensive menu, instead focusing on making a few dishes incredibly well. At 10 euros ($11 USD) for fish and chips, it’s a delicious place for an affordable and filling lunch. There are four Leo Burdock locations in and around Dublin.\r\n<br><br>\r\nFish and chips close up Ireland\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe Laundromat Café (Austurstræti 9, Reykjavík)\r\nThis cute café right on the main drag is famous and serves what I can only call American fare: burgers, pasta, sandwiches, and salads. While expensive (it’s Iceland, yo!), it’s also damn tasty. They offer excellent coffee and pastries, and you’ll find lots of people reading and writing in their comfy chairs and at tables.\r\n<br><br>\r\nSægreifinn – The Sea Baron (Geirsgata 8, Reykjavík)\r\nTurns out one of my readers in Iceland happens to be a government official, and when she took me here, I knew it had to be good. This tiny, hole-in-the-wall seafood place serves thick lobster soup with huge chunks of lobster and nice creamy broth. I’ve since heard it’s pretty famous, but when we went, there were no crowds and only Icelanders there. Regardless of who frequents it now, it’s delicious and shouldn’t be skipped.\r\n<br><br>\r\nBerlin’s Thai Market \r\nI’ve been a Thai food snob ever since living in Thailand. Even the best places in the world make me go “meh,” but this weekend food market (though there are some weekday vendors) sees Thais setting up mini stalls and selling street stall–style food just like they do back home, unencumbered by German regulation. It’s the most authentic Thai food I’ve found outside Thailand (and it’s super cheap at only a few euros per dish). Here you can gorge on pork noodle soup, som tam, Thai ice tea, and real street-style pad gra pow! Heaven!', 1, 4, 5, 1, 1, 342, '2019-05-04 06:00:25'),
